Using the W3C HTML Validator, what happens when you enter the following HTML into the "validate by input" text box:

<h1>This is a title</h1>

X The validator found errors or warnings in the HTML
The validator crashed because the HTML was in the incorrect format
The validator assumed the document was HTML5
X The validator assumed the document was something other than HTML5


QUESTION 2 OF 2

What is the message displayed once the validator successfully validates your code?

No errors found while checking this document as HTML5!
Document checking completed.
No errors or warnings to show.
X Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show.
