QUESTION 2 OF 2
Here's a while loop that is supposed to print out the values of x from 0 to 5, but there's a bug. What is missing?

while (x < 6) {
  console.log('Printing out x = ' + x);
}

X  x never increments
There's not condition to tell the loop when to stop
X  x is never assigned a start value
An if statement was used instead of a while loop
